# Josephson-Junction-Dynamical-System
Study of Lyapunov exponents for Josephson Junctions


This repository is part of the code I wrote for my undergraduate thesis, about a dynamical system called Josephson Junction. 
In this study, I have simulated the Josephson Junction behavior using Runge-Kutta Cash-Karp and computed Lyapunov exponents, with which I could identify chaotic parameter regions for individual Josephson Junctions and Josephson Junction arrays. The mentioned exponents were computed with an algorithm based on articles written by Shimada and Benettin that is explained in the code. That code could be used in any other dynamical system, making the corresponding adaptations.

The entire code was implemented by myself in Fortran. 


Soon, I will add some images and further code to complete the study.
