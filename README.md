# Josephson-Junction-Dynamical-System
Study of Lyapunov exponents for Josephson Junctions

This is part of the code I wrote for my undergraduate thesis that is about the study of a dynamical system called Josephson Junction. 
In this Study I have simulated the Josephson Junction behavior using Runge-Kutta Cash-Karp and computed Lyapunov exponents in order to indentify 
chaotic parameter regions of the Josephson Junction. The exponentes were computed with an algorithm based on articles written by Shimada and Benettin
that is explained in the code. Thata code could be used in any other dynamical system, making the corresponding adapatations.


The entire code was implementes by me in fortran. 


Soon, I will add some images and further code to complete the study.
